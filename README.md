# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to the Competitive Programming Solutions repository! Here you'll find a curated and well-organized set of C++ solutions to a wide range of problems from popular online judges. This collection is designed to help learners, enthusiasts, and competitors improve their coding and problem-solving skills. Browse through categorized directories, study different approaches, and use these solutions as a reference for your own learning journey.

## About / Overview

This repository is maintained by a passionate competitive programmer and is dedicated to helping others learn and improve their problem-solving skills. Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of C++ solutions to competitive programming problems from various online judges, organized for easy navigation and study. Whether you're preparing for contests, learning new algorithms, or looking for reference implementations, this repository aims to be a valuable resource. For questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or contact me via GitHub.

## Platforms

The solutions are primarily from the following platforms:

* **Codeforces:** Problems solved from various rounds (Div. 1, Div. 2, Div. 4, Educational Rounds) and categorized by topics like Binary Search, Bit Manipulations, Binary Tree, etc.
* **CSES (CSES Problem Set):** Solutions to problems from the CSES problem set.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* Each platform (e.g., `Codeforce/`, `CSES/`) has its own directory.
  * Within the Codeforces directory, problems are often further categorized by:
    * Specific contest rounds (e.g., `Codeforces Round 271 (Div. 2)/`)
    * Problem-solving techniques or data structures (e.g., `Binary Search/`, `Bit Manipulations/`)
* Each problem solution typically consists of a C++ source file (`.cpp`) and its compiled executable (`.exe`).

## Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), or [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/))
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository
* (Optional) An IDE or text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

## How to Use

You can browse the directories to find solutions for specific problems or to study solutions based on particular topics or contests. The code is written in C++.

### Compiling and Running Solutions

To compile and run a solution, navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` file and use the following commands:

```sh
# On Windows (using g++)
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -o solution.exe solution.cpp
./solution.exe
```

```sh
# On Linux/macOS
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -o solution solution.cpp
./solution
```

Replace `solution.cpp` with the actual filename.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution, find a bug, or want to add solutions for new problems, feel free to open a pull request. Please follow these guidelines:

* Use clear and consistent naming for files and folders.
* Add comments to explain your approach where necessary.
* Ensure your code compiles and runs correctly.
* Update the README if you add new categories or platforms.

## FAQ

**Q: Why are both `.cpp` and `.exe` files included?**  
A: The `.cpp` files are the source code, and `.exe` files are precompiled executables for convenience on Windows. You can always recompile the source code on your own system.

**Q: Can I use these solutions for learning?**  
A: Absolutely! Please use them to learn, but avoid submitting them as-is to online judges.

**Q: How can I suggest a new feature or improvement?**  
A: Open an issue or pull request on GitHub.
